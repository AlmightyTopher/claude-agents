# Implementation Plan: Agent Synchronization System

**Branch**: `001-agents-sync-maintain` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-agents-sync-maintain/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a Git-based synchronization system for Claude Code agent files across multiple machines. The system automatically detects agent file changes, validates them, commits with descriptive messages, and pushes to GitHub while preventing conflicts through pre-modification pulls and merge conflict detection. Provides graceful error handling for network failures and prompts for confirmation before destructive operations like file deletions.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: PowerShell 7.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: Git 2.30+, GitHub CLI (gh)
**Storage**: File system (agent files), JSON log files for sync operations
**Testing**: Pester 5.0+ (PowerShell testing framework)
**Target Platform**: Windows 10+, Linux, macOS (cross-platform PowerShell)
**Project Type**: single (CLI utility with library functions)
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds for sync status check, <5 seconds for commit+push
**Constraints**: Must work offline (graceful degradation), no external service dependencies beyond Git/GitHub
**Scale/Scope**: Support 50-100 agent files, multiple concurrent users, 1000s of commits over time

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Principle I: Purpose & Version Control Rationale**
- [x] Agent specification stored in GitHub repository - This feature IMPLEMENTS the sync system itself
- [x] Changes tracked through Git commits - Core functionality of this feature

**Principle II: Collaboration Through Git**
- [x] Latest changes pulled before modifications (`git pull origin master`) - FR-001 enforces this
- [x] Commit messages describe agent behavior changes - FR-003 requires descriptive messages
- [x] Changes pushed to remote after commits - FR-004 ensures automatic push

**Principle III: Autonomy & Boundaries**
- [x] One specification file per agent - FR-002 detects changes per file
- [x] No modifications to other agents' files - Validation prevents cross-contamination
- [x] Dependencies explicitly declared - Git dependencies (PowerShell, Git, gh CLI)
- [x] Unique, descriptive agent name used - "agents_sync" follows naming convention

**Principle IV: Reliability & Sync Integrity**
- [x] Agent files validated before commit - FR-008 validates syntax and required fields
- [x] Locally tested before pushing - Testing framework included in technical stack
- [x] No commits that break sync workflows - Validation prevents malformed commits

**Principle V: Security & Secrets Management**
- [x] No API tokens, keys, or credentials in agent files - FR-009 prevents credential commits
- [x] Environment variables used for secrets - GitHub auth uses git credentials (not in repo)
- [x] Sensitive patterns added to `.gitignore` - FR-013 maintains .gitignore patterns

**Principle VI: Evolution & Amendment Process**
- [x] Constitutional changes documented and approved - This feature follows constitution v1.0.0
- [x] Templates updated when principles change - N/A (no template changes needed)

**PASS**: All constitutional principles satisfied. No violations to document in Complexity Tracking.

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected. PowerShell module-based architecture with clear separation between models (data entities), services (business logic), CLI (user interface), and lib (utilities). Tests organized by type (contract, integration, unit) following TDD principles.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- **From contracts**: 3 contract test files → 3 contract test tasks [P]
- **From data model**: 4 entities (AgentFile, SyncOperation, Conflict, SyncLog) → 4 model creation tasks [P]
- **From contracts**: 3 CLI commands → 3 implementation tasks (sequential, depends on models/services)
- **From research**: 4 services (GitService, ValidationService, ConflictService, SyncService) → 4 service tasks (sequential dependencies)
- **From quickstart**: 9 user scenarios → 9 integration test tasks [P] (after implementation)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 3.1 Setup**: Initialize PowerShell module structure, Pester test framework
- **Phase 3.2 Tests First (TDD)**: Write all contract tests and integration tests (must fail initially)
- **Phase 3.3 Core Implementation**: Models → Services → CLI (sequential due to dependencies)
- **Phase 3.4 Integration**: Wire services together, add logging, file watcher
- **Phase 3.5 Polish**: Unit tests, performance validation, quickstart verification

**Dependency Mapping**:
```
Models (AgentFile, SyncOperation, Conflict, SyncLog) [P]
  ↓
Services:
  GitService (uses SyncOperation, AgentFile)
  ValidationService (uses AgentFile)
  ConflictService (uses Conflict, AgentFile)
  SyncService (uses all services, all models)
  ↓
CLI Commands:
  Sync-Agents (uses SyncService)
  Get-SyncStatus (uses SyncService, SyncLog)
  Resolve-SyncConflict (uses ConflictService)
  ↓
Integration Tests (verify end-to-end workflows)
```

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- All 4 model files can be created in parallel
- All 3 contract test files can be written in parallel
- All 9 integration test files can be written in parallel (before implementation)
- Services must be sequential (GitService → ValidationService/ConflictService → SyncService)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
- Setup: 5 tasks
- Tests First: 12 tasks (3 contract + 9 integration)
- Core Implementation: 11 tasks (4 models + 4 services + 3 CLI)
- Integration: 4 tasks (logging, file watcher, error handling, .gitignore)
- Polish: 6 tasks (unit tests, performance, quickstart validation, docs)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md created
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md created
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS - All principles satisfied
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - Design maintains compliance
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - Technical Context fully specified
- [x] Complexity deviations documented - No violations, Complexity Tracking table empty
