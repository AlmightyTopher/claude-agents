# Feature Specification: Agent Synchronization System

**Feature Branch**: `001-agents-sync-maintain`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "agents_sync - Maintain a central repository of all agent files and ensure consistency across machines through GitHub synchronization. Automatically commit and push any new or updated agent files. Require git pull before making changes to prevent conflicts. Ensure all machines with repo access stay updated by pulling latest commits. Log conflicts and provide resolution guidance. Must not overwrite or delete agent files without user confirmation. Must not push if local branch is behind remote. Must not store sensitive data like API tokens or secrets in repo. Commits must include clear messages describing agent changes. Fail gracefully if push/pull operations fail. Sync process should adapt to new agents or directory structure automatically."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: sync operations, conflict management, validation, security
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear user workflows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details found
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working across multiple machines, I need my Claude Code agent configurations to stay synchronized through a central GitHub repository, so that updates made on one machine are automatically available on all other machines without manual file copying or configuration drift.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have modified an agent file on Machine A, **When** I save and sync the changes, **Then** the changes are committed to GitHub with a descriptive message and pushed to the remote repository
2. **Given** I start working on Machine B, **When** I attempt to modify an agent file, **Then** the system first pulls the latest changes from GitHub to ensure I have the most recent version
3. **Given** Machine A and Machine B have conflicting changes to the same agent file, **When** I attempt to push from Machine B, **Then** the system detects the conflict, blocks the push, and provides clear guidance on how to resolve the conflict
4. **Given** I accidentally deleted an agent file locally, **When** the sync process runs, **Then** the system prompts for confirmation before committing the deletion to prevent accidental data loss
5. **Given** my internet connection is unavailable, **When** sync operations fail, **Then** the system provides a clear error message and allows me to continue working locally without crashing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple machines attempt to push changes simultaneously?
- How does the system handle corrupted Git repositories or invalid agent file syntax?
- What occurs when a user lacks proper GitHub authentication credentials?
- How are large binary files or non-agent files in the repository handled?
- What happens when the remote branch is deleted or force-pushed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute `git pull` before allowing any agent file modifications to ensure local repository is up-to-date
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect when agent files are created, modified, or deleted
- **FR-003**: System MUST commit changes with descriptive messages that explain what agent was modified and the nature of the change
- **FR-004**: System MUST push committed changes to the remote GitHub repository after successful commit
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect merge conflicts and prevent push operations when local branch is behind remote
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear, actionable guidance for resolving merge conflicts (merge vs rebase strategies)
- **FR-007**: System MUST prompt for user confirmation before committing agent file deletions
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate agent files before committing to ensure syntax correctness and required fields are present
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent committing sensitive data (API tokens, passwords, credentials) to the repository
- **FR-010**: System MUST fail gracefully when network operations fail, providing clear error messages without data loss
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all sync operations (pulls, commits, pushes, conflicts) for troubleshooting
- **FR-012**: System MUST adapt to new agent files automatically without requiring configuration updates
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain `.gitignore` patterns to exclude sensitive files from version control
- **FR-014**: System MUST verify GitHub authentication is valid before attempting push operations
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to view sync status showing last pull time, pending changes, and sync health

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent File**: Represents a single agent specification with unique name, purpose, capabilities, and configuration; relationships include dependencies on other agents or shared utilities
- **Sync Operation**: Represents a Git workflow action (pull, commit, push) with timestamp, status (success/failure), error messages, and affected files
- **Conflict**: Represents a merge conflict with conflicting file path, local changes, remote changes, and resolution status
- **Sync Log**: Represents a chronological record of all sync operations with timestamps, operation types, outcomes, and error details for auditing and troubleshooting
